## Rules to using this package:
    You must set your working directory to the folder that contains the files
    that you wish to process.
    
## There are two functions which are design for usage:
    `fars_map_state(state.num, year)`
        - This will display a map of the state; and the cluster of points within
          the borders of that state represent the accidents.
    `fars_summarize_years(years)`
        - This will provide a summary of the data for the inputed years.
